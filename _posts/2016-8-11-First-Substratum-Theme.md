title: First Substratum Theme

####  Hi there :)
I just started to create my very first Theme for Substratum on Android!

It's name will be lightstar, but I'll not publish it to the Google Play Store,
because I just don't want to pay any money xD

Also it will be free4ever, as I don't like to pay for any things, so why should I beg others to pay for my products ;)

[Here's a link](https://github.com/AnthyG/anthyg.theme.lightstar) to the repository
