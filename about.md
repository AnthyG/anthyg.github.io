### WhoAmI
I am a 17 year old guy who really is into programming. I started programming with python since I am 14 years old and already wrote a (not really good) chat client! Currently in my free time I also work on a website with my friend, though this is only a private little website.

### My Sayings

ᖱᗩ ᕈᙓᙓᑕᙓ make Love not War. Protect the Internet, the largest project of mankind on Earth. Don't ask for your privacy. Take it back.
